# /sdlc

Software Development Lifecycle management with intelligent intent detection and routing.

## Usage

```bash
/sdlc [natural language request]  # Smart mode - AI detects intent
/sdlc [command] [args]             # Explicit command
```

# Routing Tables

> For AI execution: match input against Cmd (exact) first, then Intent keywords.
> Always show: `🎯 Detected: <intent>  → Executing: <skill>`

# Key Behaviors

- `explore/explain/how does` → read and explain inline, no skill invoked
- `understand/analyze architecture` → `actions:understand` (creates `.sdlc/arch/` cache)
- `review/check/find issues` → `actions:cr` (creates `*.cr.md`)

## Output Structure

```
.sdlc/
├── docs/      # category-feature-date.type.md
├── harness/   # verification harnesses
└── arch/      # architecture cache
```

**IMPORTANT:** `.sdlc` folder should be placed under the user's coding project path.
