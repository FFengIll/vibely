# Specification Phase Skill

Creates detailed technical specification documents based on research findings and requirements.

## Usage

```
/sdlc spec [title]
```

## Description

Creates comprehensive technical specification documents that define what will be built, how it will work, and how components interact. Specs serve as the blueprint for implementation.

### When to Use

- After completing research and selecting an approach
- Before starting implementation work
- When requirements need to be formally documented
- For features requiring coordination across multiple developers
- To document API contracts and data structures

## Process

1. **Review Research and Requirements**
   - Review research findings
   - Clarify functional and non-functional requirements
   - Identify dependencies and constraints

2. **Check Architecture Cache**
   - Use `/sdlc understand [scope]` to generate architecture cache if needed
   - Read most specific cache available from `docs/arch/`
   - Use cached architecture info for design decisions

3. **Structure the Specification**
   - Define feature/system scope
   - Document user stories and use cases
   - Specify APIs and data structures
   - Define component interactions

4. **Add Technical Details**
   - Data models and schemas
   - API endpoints and contracts
   - State management approach
   - Error handling strategy
   - Security and performance considerations

5. **Save to Documentation**
   - Save to `docs/spec/YYYYMMDD-[title]-spec.md`
   - Include version and status

## Architecture Cache

Understand phase generates and maintains architecture cache. Spec phase reads and reuses it.

### Reading Cache

Priority order (most specific first):
```bash
docs/arch/[module]/[sub]/[comp]-arch.md  # Component (~3 days)
docs/arch/[module]/[sub]-arch.md          # Sub-module (~7 days)
docs/arch/[module]-arch.md                # Module (~14 days)
docs/arch/overview-arch.md                # Project (~30 days)
```

### Generating Cache

If no relevant cache exists:
```bash
# Generate cache for the scope you need
/sdlc understand src/auth       # Creates auth-arch.md
/sdlc understand auth/login     # Creates auth/login-arch.md
```

> **Note**: TTL values are reference guidelines only. Actual freshness depends on code changes.

**See also**: `docs/arch/ARCH_CACHE_SYSTEM.md` for full documentation

- [Tasks and deliverables]

## Open Questions

- [Question 1]
- [Question 2]

## Alternatives Considered

1. **[Alternative 1]**
   - Why not chosen: [Reason]

2. **[Alternative 2]**
   - Why not chosen: [Reason]

## References

- [Research documents]
- [Architecture cache]: `docs/arch/[relevant]-arch.md`
```

## Output Location

```
docs/spec/YYYYMMDD-[title]-spec.md
```

Examples:
- `docs/spec/20260308-user-auth-spec.md`
- `docs/spec/20260308-payment-api-spec.md`

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Overview and scope clearly defined
- [ ] Requirements documented (functional and non-functional)
- [ ] User stories/use cases included
- [ ] Data structures specified with validation
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Component interfaces defined
- [ ] State management specified
- [ ] Error handling documented
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Testing strategy outlined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Architecture cache checked/referenced (use `/sdlc understand` if needed)
- [ ] Saved to docs/spec/ with date prefix

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature with Existing Cache

```bash
# Cache already exists from previous understand
/sdlc spec "Add OAuth to Auth"
# Reads docs/arch/auth-arch.md for context
```

### Example 2: Feature Requiring New Cache

```bash
# First, generate architecture cache
/sdlc understand auth/providers
# Creates docs/arch/auth/providers-arch.md

# Then write spec using cached context
/sdlc spec "Add SAML Provider"
# Uses auth/providers-arch.md
```

### Example 3: System Component

```bash
/sdlc spec Real-time Notification System
```

Creates spec with:
- WebSocket connection management
- Notification types and formats
- Subscription mechanisms
- Delivery guarantees

## Integration

**Workflow Position:** Research → **Spec** → Coding

The spec phase translates research findings and architecture understanding into a concrete implementation plan.

## Related Skills

- **understand.md** - Generates architecture cache (use before spec)
- **doc.md** - Create and save specification documents
- **pencil.md** - Create diagrams for specifications
- **research.md** - Previous phase: provides foundation
- **coding.md** - Next phase: implements based on spec

## Tips

- Run `/sdlc understand [scope]` first to generate architecture cache
- Be detailed - ambiguity leads to implementation questions
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Think about edge cases and error scenarios
- Consider how the feature will be tested
- Reference research findings for key decisions
- Use pencil.md for complex interaction diagrams
- Architecture cache speeds up spec writing significantly
